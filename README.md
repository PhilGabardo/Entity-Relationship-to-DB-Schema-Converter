# Entity-Relationship-to-DB-Schema-Converter



## Summary

This is a script used to convert a tsv respresentation of an Entity-Relationship model to a DB schema. This is intended to be a proof of 
concept, not a general, all-purpose ER-to-DBSchema converter. The motivation for this script was an assignment that I was assigned
in a databases course that I am currently taking. The assignment involved converting a large ER model to a DB schema. This seemed like
a long and tedious task, so I decided to script it as this seemed like a fun way to get the assignment done, and I would learn the 
material inside out.


## Input/Output

The script is run as:

python ERtoSchema.py \<filename\>
